Research major cybersecurity breaches over the past 20 years and pick one to write a short essay on.

Astoria Bank

Give an overview of what the breach was and the motivations behind it.


The breach was massive! Sensitive information like SSN, name, and even medical info was sold online.

Explain where the “tech flaws” were, and how hackers were able to breach their system.
admin credentials for user “adminastoria” were pre-saved, allowing anyone complete access to the database from a public URL — no authentication needed.

What has the company done to protect against that vulnerability.


The company investigated the issue and discovered that a “former developer from India” was most likely responsible for intentionally, saving the credentials to the site.

The Astoria Company identified and confirmed the presence of the malicious scripts on its website and took them offline.

Experts found a total of 19 Astoria-owned domains using the same Adminer script that were taken offline after the Night Lion report to Astoria.
